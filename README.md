# BlogContent

This repository will contain code/samples which are used in my blog-articles.

These projects and files will have a state of "sample" so you can get an idea
or try out things. It may appear that some things are broken or have uncaught exceptions.
On one hand, i try to keep samples as complete as possible. On the other hand
some things may be ommited due to understanding.


## License

For now each project will have the MIT-License which is included in the root-directory.
It may happen that a sub-folder has another license. So this sub-folder may differ
from MIT. Please refer to the included license file if there is some in the sub-folder.


## Contribution

The projects here are just samples. If you have questions or improvements you can create an issue
and we discuss it :)
